Calculating Sentiment Values for Tweets:
    The following are the steps involved in calculating the sentiment values for each tweet. These steps are common in calculating the sentiment of each Tweet for each of the 3 tasks mentioned in part B
        * Check to see the longest phrase in the sentiment data to find the n value of the longest n-gram
        * For each tweet, remove symbols and non-alphanumeric characters from the tweet text
        * Check the sentiments of each tweet using phrases of sizes ranging from 1 to the size of the previously determined n

NOTE: The code to calculate sentiment was made into its own separate module named phrase_sentiment.py. All the Sentiment Computation functions are in that file and are called from the tweet_sentiment_kharih2.py, happiest_actor_kharih2.py and happiest_state_kharih2.py files.
