README: The details of the programs used in problem 2 are as follows.


Installed packages:
    *beautifulsoup4

To install, run the pip3 install command on the requirements.txt file as follows

pip3 install -r requirements.txt


Explanation of the solution:
    My program obtains every row of the 2nd table in the Wikipedia source after the header row. After this it retrieves a data item at a time based on its position in the row and stores it in a dictionary. Each dictionary is then stored in a list which is then returned from its function. After this, the data is written using a CSV DictWriter which is initialized with fieldnames identical to the keys of the individual dictionaries stored in the list and finally, the list of dictionaries are written into a CSV file.


Running the Program:
    My program takes a command line parameter as input for the name of the HTML file that needs to be parsed.
        Eg: python3 transform.py superbow.html


Note: I was having problems with the parsing of the HTML file. For some reason my HTML file kept getting encoded a certain way that would make it read the angle brackets (<>) of each HTML tag as (&lt; or &gt;). If my program doesn't run then this will probably be the reason for it.
